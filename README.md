First version of the QRM code and initial simulations. This notebook:

- Creates an animation of the Limit Order Book (LOB) using the same parameters as the QRM paper.
- If you run the entire notebook:
  - Saves a `.npy` file containing the invariant distribution.
  - Generates a `.gif` of the LOB animation, including mid-price evolution (typically showing 4–5 mid-price changes).
