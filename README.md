# qrm_optimal_execution

Last update (02/05): uploaded the file 
first version of the QRM code and first simulations. Creates an animation of the LOB with the same parameters than the QRM paper. 
If you run the entire notebook: saves a .npy file of the invariant distribution and a .gif of the animation of the LOB with mid price evolution (4-5 mid price changes).
